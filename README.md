2018 update: it's stupidly hard to get this to build and run right now because dependencies broke things and I was depending on a weird mode of operating gRPC which is no longer supported. I'm hoping to fix it up within the next little while!

# what is this?

Software for live coding audio effects and synths in Python and/or Julia. (again)

If you use Python, there's also some libraries for doing STFT and phase vocoder stuff. Take a look at the [examples](examples/) for more info.

There's a GUI! After building (see below), run it with `./gui`.

For each tab you open, a JACK device will be created. The bottom window is the console for viewing error messages. The top window is your workspace. Some keys are mapped for you:

* F4 will execute the current "paragraph" (delimited by blank lines).
* F5 will execute the current line or the current visual selection.
* F6 will execute the whole file.
* F11 will clear the buffer (this attemps to minimize latency).
* F12 will silence output.

If you define a function like so:
```python
def process(input, output):
  output[:] = input
```
and attach something to the JACK ports, you should hear the audio flowing through. `input` and `output` are NumPy arrays with shape `(num_channels, buffer_size)`.
